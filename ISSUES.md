### Future Implementations

## Rate Limter

Users should be limited on how many stories are created/deleted. However currently the delete endpoint is not being utilized and will be in a future release.

## Admin Approved Non Members

Currently users can upload stories when signed in or out. In a future release users that are not signed in will need to have created stories approved by admins.
